### salesforce-indicoio
This is an overview of using the Indico.io APIs from apex classes in salesforce.
We focus on a service use case for now, but there are more to come.

## Limitation
At the current time we don't have any test classes in this repo so those will have to be done in your
own org.  If you would like to contribute test classes here we would LOVE to have them.

We are working towards a package that will be deployable and contain the fields, but in the interst of time 
we decided to just share the source.  Let us know what you think!
